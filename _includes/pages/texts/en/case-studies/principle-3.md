### Protecting the integrity of democratic elections: The Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity (TCEI) helps advancing solutions

Election interference is a major threat to the universal right of people to take part in the democratic process. Still, democratic governments and technology companies around the world are scrambling to meet the challenges of the latest election meddling tactics and technologies. This is a global phenomenon, with instances of election interference seen in countries from Mexico to North-Macedonia, Ukraine to Kenya, Taiwan to Turkey.

Yet, attacks and coordinated manipulation are no longer coming from foreign malign powers alone: increasingly, the cross-border disinformation playbook is used by domestic actors trying to sow division and polarization in both authoritarian and democratic contexts.

The TCEI brings together committed and eminent persons from different backgrounds with one shared goal: to ensure people decide freely, based on independent information, who should represent them. Transatlantic and bipartisan in nature, the TCEI seeks to share best practice between decision-makers and institutions across the democratic world, raise public awareness about the risks of interference while applying on the ground new models and technologies to empower civil society and governments to defend democracy. The TCEI is an initiative of the Alliance of Democracies Foundation founded by Anders Fogh Rasmussen in 2017.

### Countering election interference:the Alliance for Securing Democracy, the Government of Canada and Microsoft are working to prevent malign interference by foreign actors

The Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD), the Government of Canada, and Microsoft are working together to strenghten the collective capacity to prevent malign interference by foreign actors aimed at undermining electoral processes through malicious cyber activities.

Throughout 2020, they brought the global community together through the organization of multistakeholder workshops, each one addressing a critical topic related to preventing interference in electoral processes. During these workshops, key observations, ideas and effective practices were collected from a diverse group of experts, practitioners and stakeholders. 

Summaries of these practices are available here: [https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/services/paris-call-trust-security-cyberspace.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/services/paris-call-trust-security-cyberspace.html). 

A more in-depth compendium is planned for the first quarter of 2021.
