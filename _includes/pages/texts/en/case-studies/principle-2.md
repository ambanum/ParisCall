### Protecting the Domain Name System: French company Nameshield ensures identity integrity and resilience

Protecting the availability and the integrity of the public core of the Internet requires close cooperation between different types of actors, including non-profit organization ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) and private companies such as Nameshield. An independent French company, Nameshield ensures identity integrity and resilience on the Internet with its own caste-based, resilient DNS infrastructures.

Cornerstone of the Web, the Domain Name System (DNS) serves as the Internet directory. This protocol translates a domain name into an IP address, based on a database distributed on thousands of machines. If the DNS falls because of data corruption or a denial of service attack, websites and emails become inaccessible.

It is crucial to guarantee the protection and availability of DNS. A new protocol, DNSSEC, has thus been developed with the support of ICANN to address vulnerabilities in the DNS. Other solutions can help ensure identity resilience, such as Registry Lock or SSL certificates. By protecting data on domain name identity cards and providing a high availability service, Nameshield contributes to the second principle of the Paris Call and protects the public core of the Internet.

### Public Core CoI: the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies will lead a community of interest on protecting the public core of the Internet

Responding to threats against the core protocols and services of the global Internet requires the cooperation of the full range of stakeholders. Most of the infrastructure, services, and products underpinning it are privately-owned, or governed and maintained by the civil society functioning as a technical community.

Whilst the idea of protecting the core Internet functions has a longer history, the notion only recently became the subject of various norm proposals, most notably by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC), which was initiated by the The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies (HCSS). Building on the GCSC Report "Advancing Cyberstability" which calls for the adoption of specific "Communities of Interest", HCSS will lead a "Community of Interest on Protecting the Public Core of the Internet" (Public Core CoI). This concerted multistakeholder initiative will gather committed supporters for the general principle of protecting the public core in a regular working group.

This group will likely examine the need to further refine the concept, discuss propagation, and explore options for implementation and monitoring of the principle as well as related norms. It will convene key stakeholders to raise awareness of the threats against the core Internet protocols and functions, develop best practices and policy proposals for adoption and implementation, and advance common understandings of violations of the principle. Organizations interested in joining the Public Core CoI can write to cyber@hcss.nl.
